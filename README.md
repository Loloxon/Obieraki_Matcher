# Obieraki_Matcher
This project was created to automate the process of matching facultative study classes to students at AGH,
so that it no longer needs to be done by people in the administration. 

The project uses Python to parse .csv files into a usable format, and to parse optimization output so that it is easier to read. 

In addition, it utilizes Minizinc to solve the optimization problem.
